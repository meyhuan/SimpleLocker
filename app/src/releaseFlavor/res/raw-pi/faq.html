    How to dismiss the permanent notifications of active mode or the lockscreen?
</b><br/>
The notification is necessary to ensure AcDisplay isn't killed by the system.
However, to hide it safely (sending test notification won't function anymore!) <a
        href="acdisplay://launch_app_info">launch app info</a> and disable showing notifications.

<b>
    When will the secure lockscreen (pattern/PIN) be implemented?
</b><br/>
It is not possible to create a custom, secure lockscreen for Android. 
Other apps that have this feature only pretend to be secure, but in the real world there's always a way to bypass them.
<br/><br/>

<b>
    When will the double-tap to wake be implemented?
</b><br/>
It is not possible to implement, cause it requires a kernel modification.
